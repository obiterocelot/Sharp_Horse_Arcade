# Sharp_Horse_Arcade
Games created in pygame for an arcade built on a raspberry pi

Currently, none of the games have been packaged. If you would like to try any of them, you are welcome to download the source code to run them. The main game file is always called index.py - just run that and you should be away sailing!
